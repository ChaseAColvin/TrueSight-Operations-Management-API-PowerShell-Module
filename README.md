# TrueSight-Operations-Management-API-PowerShell-Module
This is a PowerShell module designed to make the TrueSight Operations Management API easier to work with. It is a work in progress, but I am adding to it every chance I find the need to.

I know for sure it works with PowerShell 5.1. I have not tested it with PowerShell 6 (Core), though I do not believe I am using any cmdlets that are incompatible with it.

Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
